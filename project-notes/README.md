# Final Project Soft Pitch

Priorities for me:
1. Portfolio anchor - I want to show off my skills and interests, including especially my database work. I really love working with databases so ideally I want to be able to show my ability to work with both MongoDB (done in earlier projects) and SQL (hopefully this project)
2. I'm aiming at working in EdTech or HealthTech, although anything adjacent to databases would also be great--CRM software, for instance.

## Idea 1: School Library/Book Manager
MVP Description: Fully responsive web app database with full CRUD capabilities, aimed at helping librarians and teachers track individual library items and class sets.

Goal: I want this to be a polished portfolio piece using the SERN stack

User: K-12 school librarian and teachers

APIs: Google Books API; possibly a barcode scanner API to decode barcodes--this will require additional research

Stretch Goals:
  * Set up a 'reports' function with the ability to generate pre-defined reports
  * Set up a place to create your own reports
  * Librarian-generated content - either as a blog or as a landing page?
  * Google Calendar API integration (for due dates)
  * Possibly a barcode scanner API to decode barcodes--this will require additional research
  * Full login capability using a modern authentication tool (Auth0, OAuth, something else?)

## Idea 2: Goodreads/LibraryThing clone
MVP Description: Responsive web app database with full CRUD capabilities, aimed at consumers who want to track their reading across platforms (e.g., audiobook, ebook, library book) and also their own personal libraries (both digital and paper).

Goal: I want this to be a polished portfolio piece that uses MERN (probably)

Users: Consumers who want to manage their home libraries and share what they're reading with their friends. Goodreads is all about sharing what you're reading, LibraryThing is all about managing your library--this would do both!

APIs: Google Books; Goodreads if I can get get my hands on an API key; 

Stretch Goals:
  * Login using your other accounts: Google, Amazon, Facebook
  * Possibly a barcode scanner API to decode barcodes--this will require additional research

## Idea 3: Therapist App
MVP Description: Responsive web app for connecting therapists and clients. Each therapist would have a landing page describing their areas of expertise. Clients would be able to search by multiple properties and bookmark their favorites. 

Goal: I want this to be a polished portfolio piece.

Users: Therapists and clients

APIs: none

Stretch Goals:
  * Clients and therapists would be able to log in and schedule appointments. Integration with Google Calendar or another scheduling API would be great.
  * Integration with Zoom would be ideal - anything HIPPA Compliant
